Lot’s of removed or unused content I would like to bring into the game, plenty of general quality of life features, and especially more End content. So that’s what my goal is for this addon! It’ll try to improve your experience across all 3 dimensions, with new blocks, mobs, ores and more! There’s quite a lot to go through with this so I’ve separated each dimension into it’s own section. Get ready for a deep dive!"

It consists of several swords, of which I tried to make balanced, but since it's my first time making a mod, they might be overpowered, or they might suck. Also, I'm new to coding addons, so I haven't learned how to set up durability yet, meaning that all of these weapons are unbreakable, and i might keep it that way.\nAlso, this addon doesn't use player.json, so feel free to use it with any other mods, it won't break your world :)\nThere are different \"Tiers\" of swords based on how many times you have to craft to get them. For example,\nTier 1 Swords = swords crafted with basic materials, Tier 2 Swords = swords crafted with two tier one swords or a tier one sword with some other materials, Tier 3 Swords = swords crafted with two tier two swords or a tier two with other materials, etc."

      "content": "Overview\nThis addon adds the four nations bending abilities from the show Avatar the last Airbender (ALTA or atla)! Create realms, and customize the addon to fit your playstyle using the in-game settings.\nWhen you start out, nothing will happen. First, you will have the bending scroll in your hotbar upon entry into the world. After that, you can choose your bending by opening it (long press or right click). The options are avatar, fire, earth, water, air, and human (normal vanilla Minecraft, with the ability to learn chi-blocking).\nWhen you pick a bending style, nothing will happen either - you need to choose your moves for each of your “slots”. For instance, if you sneak then punch you will use whatever move is bound to slot 4. Let’s say you are an Airbender and used the scroll to set slot 4 to Air Blast - when you sneak and punch, you will use Air Blast. You can use your scroll to bind moves to slots. Just right-click/long press on your scroll, and click on the sub-menu button “Choose Slots”. Try picking slot 4 first(remember to click on submit after all slots choice have been filled), since it’s the simplest. Eventually, you’ll have your slots memorized, and a set of 4 moves you like best. These 4 that you have “slot-loaded” are what make you different from other benders of the same type.\nEach type of bender will have a different moveset, and each individual bender will have an even more varied set of moves. As you level up, you get access to more moves. To level up, simply go about as normal - using moves will help you level up, but don’t try to afk, it won’t work. Sometimes, bending can get annoying while just going about your normal tasks, so you can turn it off for a bit by holding arrows in your off-hand, or by typing right clicking/long pressing the scroll and then clicking/tapping settings and clicking/tapping the button that says \"Enable Bending\".\nThe moves and abilities of these classes are outlined below, and also through the bending scroll with the \"Bending Info\" section.\nHave fun playing!"

It consists of several swords, of which I tried to make balanced, but since it's my first time making a mod, they might be overpowered, or they might suck. Also, I'm new to coding addons, so I haven't learned how to set up durability yet, meaning that all of these weapons are unbreakable, and i might keep it that way.\nAlso, this addon doesn't use player.json, so feel free to use it with any other mods, it won't break your world :)\nThere are different \"Tiers\" of swords based on how many times you have to craft to get them. For example,\nTier 1 Swords = swords crafted with basic materials, Tier 2 Swords = swords crafted with two tier one swords or a tier one sword with some other materials, Tier 3 Swords = swords crafted with two tier two swords or a tier two with other materials, etc."

      "content": "Overview\nThis addon adds the four nations bending abilities from the show Avatar the last Airbender (ALTA or atla)! Create realms, and customize the addon to fit your playstyle using the in-game settings.\nWhen you start out, nothing will happen. First, you will have the bending scroll in your hotbar upon entry into the world. After that, you can choose your bending by opening it (long press or right click). The options are avatar, fire, earth, water, air, and human (normal vanilla Minecraft, with the ability to learn chi-blocking).\nWhen you pick a bending style, nothing will happen either - you need to choose your moves for each of your “slots”. For instance, if you sneak then punch you will use whatever move is bound to slot 4. Let’s say you are an Airbender and used the scroll to set slot 4 to Air Blast - when you sneak and punch, you will use Air Blast. You can use your scroll to bind moves to slots. Just right-click/long press on your scroll, and click on the sub-menu button “Choose Slots”. Try picking slot 4 first(remember to click on submit after all slots choice have been filled), since it’s the simplest. Eventually, you’ll have your slots memorized, and a set of 4 moves you like best. These 4 that you have “slot-loaded” are what make you different from other benders of the same type.\nEach type of bender will have a different moveset, and each individual bender will have an even more varied set of moves. As you level up, you get access to more moves. To level up, simply go about as normal - using moves will help you level up, but don’t try to afk, it won’t work. Sometimes, bending can get annoying while just going about your normal tasks, so you can turn it off for a bit by holding arrows in your off-hand, or by typing right clicking/long pressing the scroll and then clicking/tapping settings and clicking/tapping the button that says \"Enable Bending\".\nThe moves and abilities of these classes are outlined below, and also through the bending scroll with the \"Bending Info\" section.\nHave fun playing!"
